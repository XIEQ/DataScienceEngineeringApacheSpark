# RDD Labs

This folder contains the same labs from the Data Science and Engineering with Apache Spark XSeries. But all the labs here are finished using Resilient Distributed Dataset(RDD) instead of DataFrame. The purpose is to make myself proficient using RDD. Although DataFrame is recommended for most situations because it is more efficient, easier to use, and more expressive, knowing RDD is still helpful since DataFrames are built on top of RDDS. The article [A Tale of Three Apache Spark APIs: RDDs, DataFrames, and Datasets -When to use them and why](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/07/14/a-tale-of-three-apache-spark-apis-rdds-dataframes-and-datasets.html) gives a good comparsion between DataFrame and RDD.
